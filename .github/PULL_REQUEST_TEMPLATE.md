**Deliverable Submission**

Please describe your comfort and completeness levels before submitting.

Comfort Level (1-5): 2.5 - Was able to meet requirements, and I tried to do it on my own for the most part, but I had to ask for help and google a lot from DOM manipulation. Although I feel good that it was done, I still can't help but feel like a bit of an imposter since I needed help, and it took me hours over a few days to do this as opposed to some students. Is this normal at this point in time.

Completeness Level (1-5): 4.5 Didn't have time to figure out how to make a transition between slides. Forgot to do a lot of pseudocode since I was concentrated on getting it to work and just constantly changing things, I'm sorry.

What did you think of this deliverable?: It's a good example for what I think is coming so it definitely helps me recognize what I need to brush up on. I'd like to 100% be able to do it on my own at some point.
